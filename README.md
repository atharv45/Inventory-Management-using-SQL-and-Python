🚀 Built an Inventory & Supply Chain Management System for Non-Technical Leaders.

In many large organizations and banks, senior managers and executives need insights from data — but they don’t know SQL, and they shouldn’t have to.
So I built a complete Inventory Management & Supply Chain Dashboard using:

🗄️ SQL (Backend logic & data layer)

🐍 Python + Streamlit (Frontend UI)

The goal was simple:
 Make complex database operations usable for non-technical users.

What this system allows:
Business-friendly dashboard for viewing data
Add Products / Place Orders via simple forms
No SQL knowledge required
One click → Backend logic executes → Database updates
All heavy logic remains in SQL, invisible to the user

This is designed for:
Executives
Senior managers
Operations teams
who want results, not queries.
